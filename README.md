-------------- | --------------
4 Bars of Wifi |  The app will stop its download if it loses connection, and can prevent you from downloading other clockfaces until you finish the download.
Synced Devices |  Syncing your phone before downloading will help check that you have a good connection.
Patience       |  If you lose your patience and click on something else or swipe away before it downloads, it will give you an incomplete download.

> ## Step 4. How to uninstall the watch
> 
> go back to your app. 
> 
> Go to your Fitbit Versa 3 watch, click gallery. 
> 
> Click the clockface and then click "Remove clock face".

tip: You may want to uninstall the clockface and then re-install it to try again, especially if you partially downloaded it, but it is still in your gallery. When you start the new download, try to keep your device awake while it downloads. If you see a red X on your watch and it vibrates the download has completed, but it has also failed. The bar will start going back and forth, but at this point uninstall because it is unlikely to connect again. It is better to start with a fresh installation. Downloading from a tablet or laptop tends to be more successful for large files than a cellphone.  


tip: If that doesn't work: 

Restart Fitbit Versa and turn Phone OFF/ON

Turn Bluetooth ON/OFF

Turn Wi-Fi ON/OFF

Try changing the clock face again


## Good Luck!
