*If you see a red X on your watch and it vibrates the download has completed, but has failed. The bar will start going back and forth. See Most important tip for instructions.* 

*If it won't stop downloading, shut off just your watch by going to settings : shut down. Your app will say "Unable to install" This will help it stop.*
