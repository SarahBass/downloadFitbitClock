Step 1: Check your wifi and make sure your phone or device has synced to your fitbit watch.
Try to use atleast 4 bars of wifi. 


Step 2: Check on your download on your fitbit app on your device or cellphone. Click your Versa 3 watch under devices. Click gallery, then click clockfaces. You will see your downloaded clockfaces.
Click the watch that is downloading to check on its status. If the red bar is moving right and left, that means it is searching for your phone.


Step 3: Click on the select button and refresh the install, you may have to start over. 
Wait until it connects and a red bar starts to grow in the white downloar bar. It may be slow so 
allow several minutes if you do not have good wifi. 


When it is finally done, you should be able to select your clockface on your watch or on your device. 


Step 4. To uninstall the watch, go back to your app. Go to your Fitbit Versa 3 watch, click gallery. Click the clockface and then click "Remove clock face".


Good Luck!
